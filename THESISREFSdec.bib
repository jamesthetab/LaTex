	Abstract = {Let "HH" stand for Hochschild (co)homology. In this note we show that for many rings A there exists d is an element of N such that for an arbitrary A-bimodule N we have HHi(N) = HHd-z(N). Such a result may be viewed as an analog of Poincare duality.

Combining this equality with a computation of Soergel allows one to compute the Hochschild homology of a regular minimal primitive quotient of an enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra, answering a question of Polo.},

@article{melnikova,
	Abstract = {The notion of an aspherical pro-p-group is introduced. It is proved that if a group G = F/N is aspherical, where F is a free pro-group, then the relation Fp [[G]]-module N/N-P[N, N] satisfies'an assertion of the- type of L Yndon's identity theorem. The finite subgroups and the centre of G axe described. The structure of an aspherical pro-p-group G with a soluble normal subgroup A not equal {1} is studied. In particular, if A congruent to Z(p), then G contains a subgroup of finite index of the form A lambda W where W is a free pro-p-group.},
